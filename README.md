# ECE552 Project

Over the Fall 2020 Semester, I will be building a processor that supports the WISC-SP13 ISA. This project will
have various graded check-ins, which are loosely described below. Note that some of the wording is taken
exactly from the Course Website.

## Project Plan -- completed on 9/30/2020
A typed report describing the project design. Must include a schedule containing key
milestones and must identify how these milestones coincide with the responsibilities of the
student’s other commitments.
## Design Review -- completed on 10/13/2020
Complete a hierarchical, schematic drawing of an unpipelined processor implementation. This
drawing does not have to include pipelined stages, but it should be designed with these stages
in mind.
Student must complete a review in which they describe the datapath for any instruction within
the WISC-SP13 ISA using the schematic. Be able to defend design given control path and decode
logic implementation in mind.
## Demo 1 – Unpipelined Design -- completed on 11/5/2020
Design a single-cycle, non-pipelined WISC-SP13 processor using a single-cycle memory model.
Run a set of test programs in front of a class instructor to show that the design works correctly.
## Demo 2 – Pipelined Design
Implement pipelining in the unpipelined design and show that is runs correctly.
Write two additional tests for pipelining.
Instructor will run a set of test programs on the design and contact the student if any errors
occur.
## Cache FSM Turn-In
Build the Cache FSM and turn it in.
## Cache Demo – 2-way Set-Associate Cache
Perform a demo of the cache in front of an instructor.
